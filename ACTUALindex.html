            <h1 style="font-size:32pt;background-color:red;color:white">Why was Jenny Wearing Red Pants?</h1>
            <h1 style="font-size:22pt;background-color:violet;color:white">Sweatpants</h1>
       <p style="font-size:15pt;color:red">Jenny's red pants were not what many upper-class members would classify as pants, rather, they were sweatpants. Jenny loved her sweatpants. She had many variations and colors, but the red were her favorite. They were red Air Jordan sweatpants her mom had bought her from the boys section of Gabe's. Jenny was in fact a tomboy. She grew up playing outside and inside. Inside, she played basketball. Outside, she also played basketball in addition to softball, wiffleball, kickball, football, etc. The one sport she took interest in that didn't end in "ball" was frisbee. Her sweatpants came in handy, you see, as she sweat a lot. She felt as though they were made for her: comfortable, easy to play in, and they looked cool. They also made spinning on cardboard easy when she performed a breakdancing routine in her school's talent show. She was the first act. Her dad came late from work and missed it. She didn't care, but he did. Her favorite color was not red, but green, so her affection toward her red pants was just as much of a surprise to her as it was to anyone else. What could she get away with in the red pants? Many things, but spilling red paint on her pants in school without anyone realizing should not go unnoticed.</p>
            <h1 style="font-size:22pt;background-color:violet;color:white"> Who is Jenny Redpants Apart From Her Pants?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:15pt;color:red"> Jenny Redpants is in a class at school called Computer Science Math. Does she have a natural ability for coding? The answer becomes obvious when you look at her original code; no. However, there have been a few exceptions to this circumstance. Some may call them miracles. Others may call them accidents. Many will call them the most unfascinating, mediocre products of code ever to be created and posted on the internet. Does Jenny Redpants care what they think? Only when she has to see their reactions in person, and that's when the barrier of technology comes in handy.
